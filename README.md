Scheduler via Text

The goal of this project is to  create a schedule for you via text messages utilizing the Twilio API.
The server that we are using is Linode and we use the MongoDB database to store the schedules for each individual number.
Once you schedule an event, you will receive a text message that the event is about to start a set time before the start time previously entered.
